Hi, this is my Etch-a-Sketch submission for The Odin Project. I had a tough time getting through this but I've learned a lot through doing this such as:

- Basic DOM manipulation - selecting elements, nodelists and arrays; creating elements, appending etc..
- changing styling through JS 
- this keyword
- onlcick events and eventListeners
- creating toggles
- creating an automatically populating grid in flexbox
- Dynamically creating HTML elements in the DOM via JS
- inputs and output HTML elements and .value property
- Structuring code
- Planning and designing a program from scratch
- Importing fonts
- Creating CSS shapes e.g. circles
